### Hello, world! üòÅ
Here is Antonio Terpin, 22yo Engineering student at ETH Z√ºrich. 

Since high school I have been amazed by the simplicity of technology, despite all of the complex concepts behind. For this reason, I have always sought places where to learn something new, in many different fields.

I am a master student in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH Z√ºrich, and member of the AMZ Driverless formula student team. I have a BSc in Electronic Engineering at the University of Udine, Italy, where I was in the excellence programme "Scuola Superiore", and a Computer Science diploma from ITST J.F. Kennedy, Pordenone, Italy.

I am currently exploring the computer vision and control fields, and I love mathematics, algorithms and challenges.
